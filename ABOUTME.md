Passionate about numbers and people, I am a very hardworking person who always seeks to deliver above average results.
I worked almost 2 years in the financial area of ​​Ambev where I was able to live with amazing people and sharpen my analytical mind
in solving daily problems of fixed or variable expenses and in controlling the performance KPIs of the 4 breweries for which
my regional was responsible.
